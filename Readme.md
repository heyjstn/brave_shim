# Brave Search API Shim for OpenClaw (Dux Distributed Global Search)

This project is a local proxy (shim) that emulates **Brave Search APIs** by redirecting requests to **Dux Distributed Global Search**. It is specifically designed to allow [OpenClaw](https://github.com) (or similar agents) to operate for free, eliminating the need for official Brave API keys.

## 🚀 Features

* **Web Search**: Complete mapping of DuckDuckGo results into Brave's JSON format.
* **Local Search**: Point of Interest (POI) search simulation.
* **Summarizer**: Placeholder for RAG pipeline compatibility.
* **Systemd Ready**: Pre-configured scripts to run the proxy as a background service.

## 🧪 Verification Tests

You can verify the proxy is working by simulating OpenClaw's REST calls using `curl`:

**Web Search Test**

```bash
curl -G "http://localhost:8000/res/v1/web/search" --data-urlencode "q=OpenAI news"

```

**Local Search Test**

```bash
curl -G "http://localhost:8000/res/v1/local/pois" --data-urlencode "q=pizza in Naples"

```
